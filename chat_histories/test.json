Remember to replace `8080` with your desired port number.  Make sure the port is not already in use by another application.

They might have specific advice or settings you need to adjust.  Also, carefully examine PythonAnywhere's web app configuration;  sometimes there are settings related to file paths or access permissions that need tweaking for applications to locate files correctly.

Whether college is worth it for a coding career depends on your learning style, financial situation, and career goals.  There are definitely successful coders who haven't gone to college, proving that online tests and self-learning can be effective.  However, college offers several advantages:\n\n* **Structured Learning:** College provides a structured curriculum, ensuring you learn fundamental concepts and best practices.  This structured approach can be beneficial for building a solid foundation. \ud83d\udcda\n* **Networking:**  College provides opportunities to network with professors, peers, and industry professionals, leading to potential internships and job offers.  Networking is invaluable in any field. \ud83e\udd1d\n* **Credibility:** A college degree can provide credibility to potential employers, especially for entry-level positions. While not always necessary, it can be a significant factor in a competitive job market.  \ud83c\udf93\n* **Mentorship:** Professors and teaching assistants can offer mentorship and guidance, helping you navigate the complexities of the field.  Having experienced professionals to support you is highly beneficial. \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb\n\nUltimately, the decision is personal.  If you're a self-motivated learner who can thrive in a less structured environment and can demonstrate your skills through online tests and projects, then college might not be essential. But if you value structured learning, networking opportunities, and the credibility a degree provides, then college could be a worthwhile investment. Weigh the pros and cons carefully based on your individual circumstances and learning style.  Consider the cost of college versus the potential return on investment in your career. \ud83e\udd14\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "what are some easy online tests I could take?"}, {"role": "bot", "content": "There isn't a single \"easy\" online test that definitively proves your coding skills for all employers.

Start with easier problems to build confidence and then gradually work your way up.  Focus on understanding the underlying concepts rather than just getting the code to run. \ud83e\udd13\n\n* **FreeCodeCamp/Codecademy:** While not strictly \"tests,\" these platforms offer interactive coding courses and projects. Completing projects and demonstrating your skills through portfolio work is arguably more valuable than passing a single, isolated test.  This shows practical application of skills.  \ud83d\udcbb\n\n* **Practice on your own:** Create personal projects that showcase your abilities. This demonstrates problem-solving skills and initiative\u2014something employers value highly.  A GitHub portfolio of personal projects is exceptionally strong.  \ud83c\udf1f\n\n\n**Important Note:** Don't focus solely on \"easy\" tests.  While these can help you build foundational skills, employers will assess your abilities through increasingly complex challenges as you gain experience. Consistent practice and focusing on your learning process will be much more beneficial than just seeking \"easy wins\" on tests.
